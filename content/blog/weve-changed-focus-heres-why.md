Sorry for that clickbaity headline (Hey, we told you what we were doing in the headline, right?), but I wanted to update everyone on what's been happening, and get a little personal.

## My Story, Briefly

The first 2 times I started a business, I was doing them in response to one major event that would've affected something I took seriously. I was 17 the first time, 19 the second. Both of the times my business was my job, rather than running a business on the side. For the latter half of my 20s, though, I did just that, hoping I'd figure out what I wanted.

The differences between me as a 17 and 19-year-old starting a business versus today are:

1. I had 2 things pushing me
2. I dragged my feet on this until I found an actual business problem to solve
3. I'm not using PHP

> For the latter half of my 20s, though, I [worked a normal job], hoping I'd figure out what I wanted.

## The Self-Assessment

The 2 things that pushed me were 1) the nay-saying of focusing on teaching development and 2) being laid off (on my birthday, no less). That gave me 3 months to find a job, but I already knew I wasn't going to fit at any company I tried, no matter my accomplishments.

_What do I want?_ I thought. _To work for my customers or a company?_

Let me say that when I hated being an employee, I mean I _really_ hated it. As much as I hate the Brazilian version of the talk show _[Casos de Família](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casos_de_Família)_. Or like I hate property taxes. Or shellfish. (Seriously, though. _Casos de Família_ is the worst.) At this point, I'd finally felt I found what I wanted to do in teaching, and after having done it _pro bono_ at my last job, I saw the opportunity to teach development.

## The Problem

Employers, recruiters, and candidates all showed me that something was missing in our industry. We have so many opportunities for learning development, but there's still a missing piece of the puzzle. [Almost 90% of bootcamp students are there specifically for employment](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2016-coding-bootcamp-job-placement-demographics-report#Table6), but recruiters and employers are reticent to _hire_ those graduates. When I asked why, sure enough, that missing piece was why.

## The Reality

But I got a lot of distractions once I saw the need and started working on it, so I considered my requirements:

1. I only had a month and half. (The remaining 90 days would have to be commercializing the product.)
2. I wanted to reach people located anywhere.
3. I wanted something to help employers accelerate their business.

I'd been eager to take advice before, as a way to acknowledge I know nothing. But it was here that I realized because of these 3 things, I'm not taking or asking for advice. (I got pretty good at politely listening, considering the advice, and going forward with what I planned.) No matter what people told me, I knew anything else I did would affect one of these 3 things. I wasn't going to budge on them. I wasn't looking to get featured on some social networking site, get praised for something I haven't even done yet, or jump into doing a different version of the same things I've been doing for 11 years. I found a problem, and I wanted to solve it.

## And Now, the Solution

So what does Jogral do now? We teach software development for the real world. We have micro-courses on topics that matter. And we'll be adding more as we progress. We want to make training something worth doing rather than a diversion from work we need to do.

Now, when someone asks if Jogral builds app for people or provides support for something, the answer will be: "Sorry! We don't do that anymore. But work with us, and we'll show you how to do it!"
