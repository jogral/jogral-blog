At Jogral, we've worked with several digital marketing agencies (and some of us started our careers at digital marketing startups!),
and often we watch them struggle with being a marketing business that heavily depends on technology. Marketing is one of the best
ways for technology to show major benefits, and, of course, one of those areas is in [artificial intelligence](https://martechtoday.com/algorithms-advertising-7-steps-introducing-ai-marketing-195037).
[Amplero](https://www.amplero.com) is one such company focusing the latest in AI into helping marketers. We call this intersection of marketing and technology, naturally,
[martech](https://martechtoday.com/library/what-is-martech), and it's a great application of all the math(s) I went to grad school for and the theoretical computer science
classes I took.

Marketing _agencies_ come in all shapes and sizes, though, and when tasked with work with a lot of technical components and comparatively fewer marketing work,
some agencies get into an existential frenzy over being a full-service agency. Even interactive agencies take the plunge into nihilism as they jump into a project
with so many uncertainties.

I recently attended a meetup on starting a career in the technology landscape, and what I heard from some of the owners of technical companies there is something I've
heard from entrepreneurs for years: take as much (paid) work as you can, even if you don't know how to do it. And when that happens, you don't want to make mistakes that
result in lost customers and revenue. Today, we're going to talk about how to mitigate that.

## Prepare to Price

I've seen many small-to-mid-sized agencies not go through any sizing process during pricing. In fact, I've found them using these methods to price:

1. Guessing
2. By the customer's budget

For those of you guessing, the plane to Losing Money-ville leaves out of Gate 1. If you're going on customer budget, you're on standby. Why? It's hard to guess something
you haven't done, and if you _have_ done it, it's too easy to underestimate What Can Go Wrong&trade;. And if you go by the customer budget, you'll also contend with
What Can Go Wrong&trade; in the form of letting the customer tell you what you're worth... _if_ you're not careful.

**What to do:** Ask the team (or person) to estimate the effort/cost of the parts of the project they're going to work on. (You _did_ make sure you have someone who can
do the work, right?) You've got two options: if the customer gave you a budget, find out what is doable for your proposal; or make your proposal based on the effort and
cost required.

## Expect the Unexpected

Although I may have just made an esoteric reference to a 90's cartoon, it still fits. [Things happen](http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2011/04/amazon-the-purpose-of-pain.html),
and the best way to deal is to plan for it. We had to do this last year when one of the APIs we were using introduced a bug in their API, and the customer told us. We had to quickly
change it to adjust to the new "feature" until they fixed it, which took about a week. When you're working on something, especially **new technology**, there's all kinds of problems
that come up with the software you'll be using, especially when you need to scale. When you have customers, you never know what will happen until it happens.

**What to do:** Your price, your project timeline, and your communication need to include the What Can Go Wrong&trade;. Your pricing should include time it will take for
environmental technical idiosyncrasies (see _Prepare to Price_), your project timeline needs to give extra time for surprises, and you must communicate
to your customer what your assumptions are for the project and the customer and note that any deviation from this results in What Can Go Wrong&trade;.

## Make your contracts clear

A good thing I've seen is that everyone always states in proposals and contracts what they'll do&mdash;you kinda have to. What I don't see is what you _won't_ do.
But wait! Did I just contradict the "take as much work as you can" statement? Not at all. See, you can accept as much as you want, but your proposals should not.
I've seen it happen many times. An agency picks up a job, defines the work, and then a customer asks for a "quick" favor that ends up being a project in itself.
And this isn't exclusive to small business, either.

When I was hiring and work with agencies at a large corporation, my bosses would tell me to delegate these "quick favors" to them specifically because the agency itself,
specifically because their contract stated they could. And the agency didn't get paid for it. Another agency ended up _losing_ money by clearly and consistenly outlining
what's included and not.

**What to do:** You've probably figured it out: make sure your contracts explicitly state what is and is not included in your pricing. To most people, this is counterintuitive,
but every business I've worked well with does this. And they're _successful_. The reason for this is that it's far too easy to get over-extended and over-worked. But consider it
an opportunity. By doing this, you've got more time, which means more time closing business, and you have an upsell opportunity. Remember: you can take on the additional work,
and now it's worth more.

These suggestions are based on tough experiences, and I know it's not easy to see why you've got to do it. You're professionals, you're busy, and you're trying to run a business.
You owe it to your customers to give them professional service and expertise.
