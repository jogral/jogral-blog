&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I listened to some data scientists present their lessons learned on a retail data science experiment they conducted. The charts, graphs, and predictions they showed
accounted for 20% of the work, they said, while the 80% remaining was the most beneficial, and they said it is where data scientists really learn about their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also mentioned a sobering reality: you don't hear much about the 80% in presentations. Sometimes this is for legal reasons, other because of difficulty, complexity, and boredom.
When I ventured into this foray, the 80% left me lost, since the majority of responses were hand-wavy dismissals rather than substantive help. The fact of the matter is, though,
that the tools we have today exist to address the 80%, but it's uncommon to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]the 80% remaining was the most beneficial, and they said it is where data scientists really learn about their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the perspective of the data scientist having to manipulate and study the data ad infinitum forever before finding any kind of answers. For businesses? This is the period
that takes lots of time just to tell us something that isn't all that valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dsianalytics.com/business-value-from-data-science/"&gt;David Stephenson&lt;/a&gt; wrote that indeed not getting business value from data science is all too common.
The consensus is that a cross-functional team of data scientists, IT, and business experts working and collaborating regularly on an experiment will yield success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is well and good, but what about the &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt; business owner? In most cases, having just one person with analytical expertise is way too much to ask for. What do
small business owners do to do predictive analysis with few or no employees?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the rules for all data science experiments are universal. We're going to share 4 of them below and explain how a small or medium business can follow these
rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/static/images/how-small-businesses-can-tackle-the-other-80-percent-of-data-science/take-control.jpeg" alt="Take control" class="center-block img-responsive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Business goals are the bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's actually fairly inexpensive to have an analytics platform, so a sole proprietor to a medium-sized business can do some type of predictive data science. But it's useless
without knowing the business goals you're trying to achieve in your experiment. This is your bottom line; you must understand them intimately and ensure that if you're
working in a team that your team understands it. Stephenson mentions having a team lead who can bridge understanding between business and analytical needs. If you're doing it alone,
you're going to have to learn what tools help address the analytical needs. With that in mind...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set and accept expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be able to set deadlines and level of precision you're confident with to avoid paralysis of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're doing it alone, you have to compromise. Even for businesses that have staff, you will need to set some expectations. Data science can lend itself to distraction,
which means that you should take precautions even if you had all of the time in the world. With strong business goals, you should be able to set deadlines and level of precision
you're confident with to avoid paralysis of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same note, you have to accept that you won't have a perfect experiment. This is easy for small businesses who know that time is money, but it's still important
to understand that as you have business goals and set expectations that you need some flexibility to meet these oals and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Make sure your data has integrity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially critical for human input, but you must make sure the data sources yield useful data. This is where it is beneficial having someone who can translate
business needs into analytical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your business intuition and knowledge can also help dealing with tricky data. Someone who can explain blank values, abbreviations, conditional answers, etc. helps in
the understanding process, and it helps in meeting those expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/blog/static/images/how-small-businesses-can-tackle-the-other-80-percent-of-data-science/data.jpeg" alt="Data" class="center-block img-responsive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get your data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: allow yourself to prepare for future needs. After all, data science is a continuous process. Don't hold your important data hostage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many posts, it's easy to know the rules, but not always easy to follow. When you're treading new territory, it's hard to know what to expect. The good thing is what
you'll always have an opportunity to use what you've learned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="data science"></category><category term="analytics"></category><category term="business"></category></entry></feed>
