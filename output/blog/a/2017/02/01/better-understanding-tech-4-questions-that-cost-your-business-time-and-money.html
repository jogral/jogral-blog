      <p><img src="/blog/static/images/better-understanding-tech-4-questions-that-cost-your-business-time-and-money/frustrated.jpeg" alt="A frustrated person" class="center-block img-responsive"></p>
<p>This past weekend, I was lurking Reddit's small business subreddit, debating if I wanted to create an account or not. I had been facing some
challenges, and I was curious how others in business overcame them.</p>
<p>Eventually, I looked at what <em>software</em> businesses were doing, and came across some enterprising technologists asking business owners about
the challenges they face <strong>that could be solved with software</strong>. Feedback was all over the board, but some of that advice
was spot on, while nearly every answer pointed to a bigger problem: not knowing value. Why should anyone ever spend money on technology?</p>
<p>For technology businesses, this is a challenge when trying to get customers. It's like there's always a big sign saying <em>WHO CARES</em> whenever
talking to a business about what technology can do. But surprisingly, as business owners, <em>not</em> knowing about technology is just as challenging
because of the ever-prevalent cliché that *<em>you don't know what you don't know</em>&amp;.</p>
<p>We made a special page partially addressing that issue, but for today, we're going to look at some common questions we've seen/heard, a short
explanation, and our recommendation for each question.</p>

<h2>"How do you make an app?"</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/static/images/better-understanding-tech-4-questions-that-cost-your-business-time-and-money/startup-photos.jpg" alt="Project planning" class="center-block img-responsive"></p>
<p><strong>This is the most important question, because it relates to every other problem.</strong> Almost every app developer will say, "It depends." Because it does.
The needs of a medical device company, as well as the existing technologies they have, will require a different approach than a chocolatier. But
honestly, the biggest factor is <em>their existing IT environment</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Ask more pointed, specific-to-your-business. If you <a href="/a/choose-goals-not-technology-to-grow-your-business">consider your business before your tech</a>,
this should be easy. If you think you need an app to, say, streamline placing orders to your vendors, ask how to build <em>that</em> app.</p>
<h2>"Why is there no...?"</h2>
<p>It's not so much that a tool or technology doesn't exist, it's that it's either too expensive or would be too customized. In the case of integrating between two
systems, it's usually a combination. Either way, the reality is the technology does exist or could be made, but you'll probably need someone to build that (see #1)
or pony up a lot of cash. If a consultant or firm is subtly trying to push using another tool (or upgrade), ease of integration is probably the reason.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Ask about the integration capabilities of the tools you are using. Sometimes, that means you'll eventually get a "We'll look into that for you," but
a <em>good</em> developer will know what to look into.</p>
<h2>"Can I let my web designer build my app?"</h2>
<p><strong>Doing this will lead to pain.</strong> I've seen many businesses just have one person do (or try to do) work separate from what they were hired or can do. Technical roles
are not interchangeable, and treating them that way will result in degraded work, additional cost, and frustration. It's much better to find out <em>which</em> role does what.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> There are many titles for this type of person, but find a trusted technical architect/advisor/CTO who can help you understand who should do what.
Simply tell them what you're trying to do and ask for guidance on figuring out the right type of professional. This will actually benefit you and the technologists
out there, since this problem frustrates IT professionals as much as it does business owners.</p>

<h2>"How can I get technical staff to understand my requirements?"</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/static/images/better-understanding-tech-4-questions-that-cost-your-business-time-and-money/explanation.jpeg" alt="Woman in Gray Shirt Seating in Between Woman in Blue Black and White Plaid Long Sleeve Shirt and Man in Blue White and Black Plaid Long Sleeve Shirt Having Conversation" class="center-block img-responsive"></p>
<p>Someone who understands business <em>and</em> technology (i.e., has been "in the trenches" for a substantial period of time) is not easy to find. Business owners are
"stuck" trying to explain their needs, with little success. "Just tell me what I need!" is a common complaint.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> This was also mentioned on one of the Reddit posts: use user stories. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">Garbage in, garbage out</a>
applies to technical requirements as much as it does the technology itself. Give technical staff an opportunity to visualize users to explain requirements. In fact, this
is <a href="http://www.storyboardthat.com/articles/b/agile-user-stories">a core tenet of agile development</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that we have this under our belt, we will next get into what goes into the projects, and "hidden" costs that affect IT projects. Need some help until then?
