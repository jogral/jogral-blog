<p>When I was a heads-down, headphones-wearing coder, I cringed whenever we had a critical project to <em>implement a new technology</em>.
Most of the time, these projects were only greenlit because someone in charge read or heard about something interesting or novel
and decided we needed it. Those projects usually failed. In grad school, I wrote a research paper on why tech projects fail,
and in one study<sup>1</sup>, poor planning, misunderstanding requirements, and unrealistic expectations were the causes leading to failure
<strong>before the projects even began</strong>. Technology projects lend themselves well to these problems.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So, with ideas like data science, deep learning, "Internet of Things," artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, etc. being en vogue right now, the
best way to get on the "cutting edge" of technology is to <strong>stop thinking about them</strong>.</p>
<p>If you ever found yourself enamored or mystified by things likes <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16008589011">Amazon Go</a>/<a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/2924247/unmanned-minnesota-organic-food-store-transforms-grocery-store-model-with-technology/">unmanned grocery stores</a></strong>,
<strong>autonomous cars</strong>, or <strong>predictive modeling</strong>, consider why these technologies exist. Do they exist out of necessity or
to find something to brag about during happy hour?</p>

<p>I read a comment on LinkedIn once from someone who said R&amp;D and not "high school diplomas" will drive technology innovation. This kind of thinking
is how we fall into the trap of seeking buzzwords instead of business. Technologies&mdash;like the mathematics that helped make them&mdash;are valuable
once there's an application. Have you ever seen a technology you thought was neat but you saw no practical application for?
Your strategy for your business and its success depend on you knowing the business goal.</p>
<p>We had a business goal of having a maintainable way to keep track of customers we've talked to in a painless way while also being able to use that activity
to evaluate where we can improve and where we already excel. You probably recognize that in this simple scenario, we were looking for a CRM, but by having
these goals, we knew what we were trying to do and ultimately what our requirements were, and validating selections against our goals made us set realistic expectations.
We didn't get a CRM, because every company I've ever worked for has one. We got it, because it's a great way to solve our problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody buys or invests in something because of features. They buy, because the product helps them achieve their goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we and what retailers did was make technology a <em>component</em> of our goal. As a programmer, I&mdash;and others in-the-know about computer hardware&mdash;often say
Apple computers have relatively inferior hardware. Then, why is a company like that successful? Their goal is to make a luxury item that feels exclusive,
convenient, and simple, and so they emphasize <em>design</em> over features. Nobody buys or invests in something because of features. They buy, because the product
helps them achieve their goal.</p>
<p>When you are running a business, you should always be strategizing and setting goals. Look at where you want your business to go, then think about how technology
can help you get there.</p>
