<p>Sorry for that clickbaity headline (Hey, we told you what we were doing in the headline, right?), but I wanted to update everyone on what's been happening, and get a little personal.</p>
<h2>My Story, Briefly</h2>
<p>The first 2 times I started a business, I was doing them in response to one major event that would've affected something I took seriously. I was 17 the first time, 19 the second. Both of the times my business was my job, rather than running a business on the side. For the latter half of my 20s, though, I did just that, hoping I'd figure out what I wanted.</p>
<p>The differences between me as a 17 and 19-year-old starting a business versus today are:</p>
<ol>
<li>I had 2 things pushing me</li>
<li>I dragged my feet on this until I found an actual business problem to solve</li>
<li>I'm not using PHP</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>For the latter half of my 20s, though, I [worked a normal job], hoping I'd figure out what I wanted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Self-Assessment</h2>
<p>The 2 things that pushed me were 1) the nay-saying of focusing on teaching development and 2) being laid off (on my birthday, no less). That gave me 3 months to find a job, but I already knew I wasn't going to fit at any company I tried, no matter my accomplishments.</p>
<p><em>What do I want?</em> I thought. <em>To work for my customers or a company?</em></p>
<p>Let me say that when I hated being an employee, I mean I <em>really</em> hated it. As much as I hate the Brazilian version of the talk show <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casos_de_Família">Casos de Família</a></em>. Or like I hate property taxes. Or shellfish. (Seriously, though. <em>Casos de Família</em> is the worst.) At this point, I'd finally felt I found what I wanted to do in teaching, and after having done it <em>pro bono</em> at my last job, I saw the opportunity to teach development.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Employers, recruiters, and candidates all showed me that something was missing in our industry. We have so many opportunities for learning development, but there's still a missing piece of the puzzle. <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2016-coding-bootcamp-job-placement-demographics-report#Table6">Almost 90% of bootcamp students are there specifically for employment</a>, but recruiters and employers are reticent to <em>hire</em> those graduates. When I asked why, sure enough, that missing piece was why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>What do I want?</em> I thought. <em>To work for my customers or a company?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Reality</h2>
<p>But I got a lot of distractions once I saw the need and started working on it, so I considered my requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>I only had a month and half. (The remaining 90 days would have to be commercializing the product.)</li>
<li>I wanted to reach people located anywhere.</li>
<li>I wanted something to help employers accelerate their business.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd been eager to take advice before, as a way to acknowledge I know nothing. But it was here that I realized because of these 3 things, I'm not taking or asking for advice. (I got pretty good at politely listening, considering the advice, and going forward with what I planned.) No matter what people told me, I knew anything else I did would affect one of these 3 things. I wasn't going to budge on them. I wasn't looking to get featured on some social networking site, get praised for something I haven't even done yet, or jump into doing a different version of the same things I've been doing for 11 years. I found a problem, and I wanted to solve it.</p>
<h2>And Now, the Solution</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter what people told me, I knew anything else I did would affect one of these 3 things. I wasn't going to budge on them. [...] I found a problem, and I wanted to solve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what does Jogral do now? We teach software development for the real world. We have micro-courses on topics that matter. And we'll be adding more as we progress. We want to make training something worth doing rather than a diversion from work we need to do.</p>
<p>Now, when someone asks if Jogral builds app for people or provides support for something, the answer will be: "Sorry! We don't do that anymore. But work with us, and we'll show you how to do it!"</p>
